Additional Considerations:
Styling: Apply appropriate CSS to ensure forms are visually appealing and user-friendly.
Validation: Implement client-side validation for required fields (HTML5) and possibly server-side validation for security.
Error Handling: Display clear error messages for incorrect input or form submission issues.
Responsive Design: Ensure forms adapt well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) for a seamless user experience.
Confirmation Emails: Set up backend logic to send confirmation emails upon successful registration and job application submissions.
This design approach adheres to the requirements outlined, focusing on simplicity, functionality, and user engagement to enhance the applicant experience on WTR Corporation's careers page. Adjustments can be made based on specific branding and usability preferences of WTR Corporation.
